# AuthorIdentification

All of us have unique wirting styles. Our styles differ interms of the words we use, their relative ferquencies,length of sentences, kind and frequency of the punctuation,Capitalisation of some specific words.Above differences are much more distinguishable  in  famous  authors and most of the times we prefer specific authors just because of their specific elements of their style.

Identifying these unique styles from text has many applications in the industry such as verifying authorship claims for ancient texts, changes in ancient text that are added later and also, to find distinghusing features for different writers. 

In this project we try to develop machine learning algorithm that identifies author given a sentence. Also, in the Exploratory data analysis, we identify some features that are unique to these authors.
